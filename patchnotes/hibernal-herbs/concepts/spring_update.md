  <h2> Version 0.7+ </h2>
  <h4> The Spring Update & General Plans Regarding 2023 </h4>
  
  <br>
  
</div>

<p>
  This update does not have a set time of release. However, it will most likely release sometime mid-march to late-april. I want the updates for Hibernal Herbs to kind of slow down, and there's a few reasons for that.
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, as MMD Winterjam 2022 has officially come to an end (roughly a month ago), I felt that it was fair to not update the mod with any major content changes. This will be the case for most project updates, except for some minor/major QOL changes, such as this update. Another reason as to why I want the updates to slow down for Hibernal Herbs is because I have other mods to update and polish. While I currently have been doing fine updating my smaller mods, it's been hard to come up with features for a larger project such as 'Boleatte.' This doesn't mean I'll never have a major update to Hibernal Herbs, it simply means that it will update at a slower pace as opposed to the near weekly updates for the original few months of development.
</p>
<p>
  I plan to give Hibernal Herbs seasonal updates, with this being the first of many. While I do not have a finalized order/list of these updates, I have some in mind;
  
  <h5> Planned/Upcoming Updates </h5>
  
<ul>
  <li> Spring Update [March-April 2023] </li>
  <ul>
    <li> v0.7 (Mainline Release) </li>
    <li> Adjusting the Herb Fertilizer Item, as well as adding some spring-related herbs and the like </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Summer Update [June-July (?) 2023] </li>
  <ul>
    <li> v0.7.? (Bugfix/Patch) </li>
    <li> Potentially Updating To Minecraft 1.20 and updating the Herb Fertilizer Features introduced in Version 7.0 </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Halloween Update [October-November 2023] </li>
  <ul>
    <li> v0.8 (Mainline Release/Patch) </li>
    <li> 1 Year Anniversary Of Development! </li>
    <li> Mainly Adding 'Spooky' Related Features, such as more herbs that could be found in the Taiga biomes (by default, I plan to have it spawn in all taiga biomes, but this could change leading up to the release). Also, fix any bugs that may have been caused in the previous updates. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Winter/Festive Update [December-January 2023-2024] </li>
  <ul>
    <li> v0.9 (Major Release) </li>
    <li> I plan to add several new herbs (potentially doubling the amount of herbs in the mod). Of course, these herbs will still have the same premise as the other ones, which is that they will be based on herbs that are cold-resistant. (this, of course, is only existant for herbs based on actual herbs that exist in real life. Herbs such as fennkystral or punuel, etc. are not affected by this premise, as they do not actually exist) </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
</p>

  <h3> What is Planned For Version 0.7? </h3>
  
</div>

<p>
  As previously mentioned, I plan to overhaul how Herb Fertilizer works and how you obtain it. Herb Fertilizer will most likely not become a legacy item, as I plan to adjust it in a way that allows it to stay in the main mod. This could change, as things do sometimes go wrong. Whether this be not being able to figure out how to do it properly, or just not being able to do it in time, could cause a different course of action to be applied in the update. Thank you for your understanding either way!
</p>
<p>
  I do have some ideas for these updates, which I'll breifly go over here. Remember, these are only concepts and may not be implemented for a while, if at all.
</p>

<h3> New Herb Reproduction </h3>

<p>
  While I am mostly happy with how Herb Reproduction works right now, I do think it could use improvement. I also felt like Myqueste wood wasn't really all that interesting, as it worked nearly the exact same as every other wood type in the game and other mods. I hadn't even bothered to add a button or pressure plate into the mod for the wood type, let alone a boat. This will be added eventually, but not top priority. Back to the topic of Herb Reproduction.
</p>
<p>
  This process may seem tedious, or even semi-pointless at first. But, again, this is only a concept and will most likely change before it releases to the public. The process that I have in mind goes as follows; Combining any herb in the mod with (mostly) any kind of dirt in a crafting grid will give you a new item called, "Herb Humus." Using this item on a stripped piece of Myqueste wood (or hopefully any wood) will allow you to combine it with 2 bonemeal in a crafting grid, which will give you herb fertilizer.
</p>

<h4> What Are The Plans For Herb Humus? </h4>

<p>
  Herb Humus is currently planned to save the wood type you right-clicked, which will determine the variation of herb fertliizer you craft.
</p>
<p>
  Woods such as Acacia or Jungle, will basically make the Herb Fertilizer act as it does now, only giving you back 1 non-pounded herb from a single pounded herb. However, woods like Spruce or Myqueste, will allow you to recieve more than just 1 non-pounded herb back, as these wood-types are more suitable for colder environments. (if this reasoning doesn't make sense, don't worry. I'm open to feedback from the community, and these features are still being concepted/drawn out).
</p>

<h3> Potentially New Herbs? </h3>

<p>
  I have some ideas for new herbs, shouldn't come as a surprise. But in all seriousness, it would make sense for a vegetation-based mod to have a decent few new features in Spring, the seasons for plants. Some concepts are listed below, again, community feedback is always welcome!
<ul>
  <li> Lepiveso </li>
  <ul>
    <li> This isn't inspired by an herb in real life, similar to Punuel or Fennsel </li>
    <li> This herb would be used as a key ingredient in a new blend recipe! A blend providing Levitation to the target, following the same guidelines/rules as the other Herb Blends. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Comfrey </li>
  <ul>
    <li> This herb is inspired by an herb in real life, taking on the same name! </li>
    <li> This herb would be used as a resistant ingredient of sorts. In certain recipes, you would add this in the 'pounded-herbs' slots in the recipe. If the given blend would typically be negative, then it would actually turn into the opposite effect (this would only be the case if the usual recipe provided a negative blend, this will not work if the typical blend is positive, such as Regenerative or Dashing blends). For example, Poison or Wither would turn into Regeneration, or Mining Fatigue would turn into Haste. This herb would be extremely hard to find, as it could prove to be quite powerful in terms of balancing. Community feeback is always appreciated! </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Sage </li>
  <ul>
    <li> This herb also is inspired by an herb in real life, taking on the same name! </li>
    <li> This herb would be a key ingredient, used in another new blend recipe! This blend would provide the target with Invisibility. Again, this would also follow the same guidelines/rules as every other Herb Blend in the mod. </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h4> What's This? </h4>
  
  <p> Hello! If you're reading this far, thank you. As a thank you, I would like to provide some 'alpha' textures/features that were scrapped before the mod was officially released! Feel free to use them (with credit) if you'd like! </p>
